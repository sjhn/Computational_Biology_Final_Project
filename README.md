# Problem Definition

## Background

Evolutionary theory predicts that a balanced sex ratio should be maintained by frequency-dependent selection. Organisms with environmental sex determination, however, are vulnerable to maladaptive sex ratios, because environmental conditions vary spatio-temporally. For reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), nest-site choice is a behavioural maternal effect that could respond to sex-ratio selection, as mothers could adjust offspring sex ratios by choosing nest sites that will have particular thermal properties. 

## Data

The data used here, was collected to directly test the hypothesis that females choose nest sites to alter the incubation temperature, perhaps influencing the sex-ratio of their offspring. To measure nest site temperature, physiological [devices](https://www.ibuttonlink.com/collections/thermochron?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIh6zQpZTO7QIVBKiGCh1X_wdzEAAYBCAAEgJAJfD_BwE/ "Temperature Logging iButtons") have been placed in the nests that record throughout the day. The researchers compared recorded temperatures of [painted turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_turtle "Painted Turtle") from maternally selected nest sites with those from randomly selected nest sites. The goal is to process the raw temperature data from the nests to determine whether maternal nests have different incubation temperatures than random nests.
